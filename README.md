## Contents

This repository contains the following files and folders:

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository.
- `Data_sets/`: A directory containing the AAM formulations as tabular data that have been used for the experiments in this publication as csv files. The files are:
    - 1_DS_cube_100_1_Strength.csv
    - 2_DS_cube_100_2_Strength.csv
    - 3_DS_cube_100_3_Strength.csv
    - 4_DS_cube_100_4_Strength.csv
    - 5_DS_cube_100_5_Strength.csv
    - 6_DS_cube_150_2_Strength.csv
    - 7_DS_cyl_100x200_1_Strength.csv
    - 8_DS_cyl_100x200_2_Strength.csv
    - 9_DS_cyl_100x200_3_Strength.csv
- `Results/`: A directory containing the results of the experiments conducted in this publication. It has two subfolders:
    - `Model_Performance_Baseline_Python/`: A directory containing the baseline benchmarking of the machine learning models as a jupyter notebook.
    - `SL_Results_Matlab/`: A directory containing the results of the Sequential Learning (SL) benchmarking with the respective model pipelines. It has two subfolders:
        - `MEI_Results_Exploit/`: A directory containing the result files for the SL benchmarking with the exploit strategy, along with a Matlab script `Plot_resultsMEI.m` to read and plot the results.
        - `MLI_Results_Explore/`: A directory containing the result files for the SL benchmarking with the explorative strategy, along with a Matlab script `Plot_resultsMLI.m` to read and plot the results.
- `SLAMD_Benchmarking_App/`: A directory containing the SL Benchmarking app SLAMD, which has created the SL results. It has been cloned from the repo https://github.com/BAMresearch/SequentialLearningApp and contains all necessary files and a detailed `README.md` that explains installation and usage of SLAMD.
