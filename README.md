## Abstract

This paper presents a novel approach for developing sustainable building materials through ecologically informed sequential learning. Large data sets with different types of alkali-activated building materials, including fly ash and blast furnace slag-based concrete, were compiled from the literature to develop and evaluate this approach. Based on these data, an extensive experimental study was conducted to compare the performance of the proposed material design methods under simulated laboratory conditions derived from real-world scenarios. The results indicate a significant reduction in development time enabled by lower research costs and straightforward predictions through machine learning.
